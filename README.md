You can get a new daily wordle by running the dailyword.py script. To automate this to happen every day you can use task scheduler [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9A8TelGsdo&list=WL&index=1](url)
If you use task scheduler you have to edit the dailyword.py script and remove the hashtag at the last line.
This will make it so you pc turns off after the script has run.
Only do this if you have scheduled this at midnight.
